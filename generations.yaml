    description: "The Hyundai Santa Cruz is the brand's first pickup truck for the North American market, though Hyundai positions it as a 'Sport Adventure Vehicle' rather than a traditional truck. Built on a unibody platform shared with the Tucson crossover rather than a body-on-frame construction typical of most pickups, it features distinctive styling with a bold parametric grille, T-shaped daytime running lights that blend into the grille pattern, and a coupe-like sloping C-pillar. The four-door crew cab configuration is the only body style offered, paired with a 4-foot bed that includes an underfloor storage compartment, integrated steps in the bumper for easier bed access, and an available lockable tonneau cover. Powertrain options include a 2.5L naturally aspirated four-cylinder producing 191 HP and a more powerful 2.5L turbocharged four-cylinder delivering 281 HP, both paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission (conventional with the base engine, dual-clutch with the turbo) and available with front-wheel or HTRAC all-wheel drive. The interior shares much of its design and technology with the Tucson, featuring a 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster, available 10.25-inch touchscreen infotainment system, and comprehensive active safety features through Hyundai SmartSense. With maximum towing capacity of 5,000 pounds (with the turbocharged engine) and payload around 1,600 pounds, the Santa Cruz offers more capability than typical crossovers while emphasizing on-road comfort and handling rather than competing directly with traditional midsize trucks. As Hyundai's entry into the growing segment of lifestyle-oriented compact trucks, the Santa Cruz targets urban and suburban buyers who occasionally need truck utility but prefer the everyday livability of a crossover, positioning it as a unique alternative to both conventional pickup trucks and SUVs."
